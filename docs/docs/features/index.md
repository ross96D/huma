# Features

Huma is a modern, simple, fast & flexible micro framework for building HTTP REST/RPC APIs in Golang backed by OpenAPI 3 and JSON Schema. Pronounced IPA: [/'hjuːmɑ/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet). The goals of this project are to provide:

- A modern REST or HTTP RPC API backend framework for Go developers
  - Described by [OpenAPI 3.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md) & [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
- Incremental adoption for teams with existing services
  - Bring your own router, middleware, and logging/metrics
  - Extensible OpenAPI & JSON Schema layer to document existing routes
- Guard rails to prevent common mistakes
- Documentation that can't get out of date
- High-quality generated developer tooling

Features include:

- Declarative interface on top of your router of choice:
  - Operation & model documentation
  - Request params (path, query, or header)
  - Request body
  - Responses (including errors)
  - Response headers
- JSON Errors using [RFC9457](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9457) and `application/problem+json` by default (but can be changed)
- Per-operation request size limits with sane defaults
- [Content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) between server and client
  - Support for JSON ([RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259)) and optional CBOR ([RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) content types via the `Accept` header with the default config.
- Conditional requests support, e.g. `If-Match` or `If-Unmodified-Since` header utilities.
- Optional automatic generation of `PATCH` operations that support:
  - [RFC 7386](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7386) JSON Merge Patch
  - [RFC 6902](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902) JSON Patch
  - [Shorthand](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/shorthand) patches
- Annotated Go types for input and output models
  - Generates JSON Schema from Go types
  - Static typing for path/query/header params, bodies, response headers, etc.
  - Automatic input model validation & error handling
- Documentation generation using [Stoplight Elements](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements)
- Optional CLI built-in, configured via arguments or environment variables
  - Set via e.g. `-p 8000`, `--port=8000`, or `SERVICE_PORT=8000`
  - Startup actions & graceful shutdown built-in
- Generates OpenAPI for access to a rich ecosystem of tools
  - Mocks with [API Sprout](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/apisprout) or [Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism)
  - SDKs with [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) or [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen)
  - CLI with [Restish](https://rest.sh/)
  - And [plenty](https://openapi.tools/) [more](https://apis.guru/awesome-openapi3/category.html)
- Generates JSON Schema for each resource using optional `describedby` link relation headers as well as optional `$schema` properties in returned objects that integrate into editors for validation & completion.
